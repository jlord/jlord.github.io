- Welp, was bAcK iN tHe hOsPiTaL this week!
- My body flipped out over an antibiotic I'd had 3 times in the last 2 years and as recently as November. Face and throat swollen, rash and hives from scalp to toe. 
- But I got to ride in an ambulance! I had the best EMTs, I would have hung out with them all night, if it weren't, you know, for my immune system being so fussy. 
- They sure do run a hospital all night long. They took me for a chest x-ray at 3am. I was miserably itchy and nauseous. 
- Covid has wrecked my immune system. For how long? What else will happen?
- The weekend, quite opposite, was marvelous. Sunny. Warm with a breeze. Bird-watched in my garden. Frozen margaritas in my garden with one friend and reading in the park with another.
- I finished [reading](/reading) _The Trouble with Happiness_ by Tove Ditlevsen. It's grim. So Danish.
- I am still quite itchy all over. 
- There's a lot on my plate and a lot in the air.
