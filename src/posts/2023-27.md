- Heyo, posting on a Monday, that's improvement. 
- Other improvements remain so-so. 
- The steroids really sent me for a ride last weekâ€”it was not great. My check-in at the hospital took 4 hours. I have one this week too.
- A friend came over and spent and evening with me and that was crucial but there still was far too much of the maddening silence and aloneness. 
- The weekend, however, was redeeming; friends came together for another friend going through a breakup. I wish the circumstances were better but it was good to be together! 
- I think I might have gone a whole month without finishing a book? I've played a lot more Animal Crossing and mindlessly streamed court trials in the US on YouTube.
- I move into *my* flat on Friday! Will be working extra hard to keep my brain ok with the checklists and deadlines.
