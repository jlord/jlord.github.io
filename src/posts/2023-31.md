- I've fallen behind again. Here come 3 posts!
- It's very hard for me to sit still and _rest_ at home. It's partly because that's how I am and it's partly the energy side-effect of the steroids. So I put myself on a train and got out of town for a couple of days. 
- It was great to have no dishes, laundry or new house chores I could possibly do and generally few options of what to do. 
- Back at home, my friend came over and co-worked with me one day so that I'd also not have to fight the urge to do a lot of stuff and could sit still.
- I began a battle with my old landlord who had not, at this point, returned my deposit as required within 10 days.
