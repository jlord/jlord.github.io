- I've entered my immunosuppressants era.
- The awful, quality-of-life-destroying steroid era of the past few months is failed and over. 
- My check-in Friday went as they usually do: entirely new doctor who hasn't read my charts and I have to build up and convince him of my universe from the start. He was stumped, called in a consultant and I begged for no more steroids. 
- I [read](/reading) _When We Cease to Understand the World_ which was really different and fantastic. Science, eerie. Amazing connections between ideas and humans and war. I didn't love how women were treated and it centering just around men. 
- It's tough to be back at square one. Still suffering, still no idea if and when I'll be better. Still alone. Still in a world that thinks covid is no big deal.
