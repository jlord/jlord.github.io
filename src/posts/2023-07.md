- The GP said that most everyone that doesn't get over covid in 4 weeks gets over it in 12 and this was week 10. Things are getting better but symptoms still occur. 
- I went to see Carly Rae Jepsen with a friend; this was my first "late" night in over a month since I'd set a strict recovery bedtime (and have been getting nearly 9 hours sleep a night). Carly Rae Jepsen is really the *best*. 
- I went into work's parent company's office to try and make friends; a friend and I tried together to wedge ourselves into conversations, it wasn't successful but there were snacks. 
- I finished [All Our Yesterdays](/reading) by Natalia Ginzburg, it's my favourite book of recent memory. I haven't tried to think further back.

- The usual correspondence with solicitor, estate agent, tax preparers, doctors. The usual loneliness. The usual, the news/world is upsetting.
- I didn't grow up in suburban Georgia, become an urban designer and move to the UK a dozen years later for people to be banging on about how 15-minute cities are a bad idea. 
- Doing these couple of "normal" social things recently resulted in 3 nights of 10 or nearly 10 hours of sleep.
