- I can't decide if and how I want pictures on these posts. 
- I'm still feeling better and trying to find just the right balance of getting a little bit of life in while not compromising recovery. Am getting a lot of 9hr+ of sleep nights so my body is definitely working hard. 
- Tuesday I went to a talk my MP gave—my MP! I didn't realise she was my MP until afterwards. But now I know!
- I went to see the footie! Brentford v Chelsea. I support Brentford—I'm a West London gal and Brentford was my first match **18 years ago** just before I spent a summer there. Brentford won! 
- I'd like to go to more matches, a US friend was in town for this one, but I need a _local football friend_. Hear my plea! 
- There was a re-org at work and I'm on a new team. I'm excited and optimistic, especially so as the team is closer to my timezone. 
- I foraged for wild garlic in South London and made pesto from it. I don't know if this exists in the US too but what a revelation! An incredible flavour, so abundant and so easy! 
- I went for a walk along the Thames at Richmond, I love this part of the river. It's pastoral and the sound of leaves blowing and water lapping soothes my soul. I ate a sandwich and sat on a bench in the lovely garden of a 17th century estate. _See photo above_.
- I also had to do a short run because I left my camera on a park bench. Luckily it was there, being guarded by a kind couple. 
- It's a bank holiday weekend so I'll include today, Monday: I overdid it this weekend (there was a lot of walking). I feel worn out, my throat hurts. I'm resting and hydrating. 
- I was accepted into a Long Covid study!
