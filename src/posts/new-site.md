I don't even dislike my old site (now in this [repo](https://github.com/jlord/old-site), at [this address](https://jlord.github.io/old-site)). I love what I've called for years now _website blue_, the shock of colbalt (and here it persists). I like the type enough that it's what's on this new site, too. But I felt like something new and I felt like something really simple. So I've spent about two years fussing with colors. Anyway, **long live HTML and CSS**. 

## A Few Words on the New Site

How simple can I make this? It's left aligned! No buttons?! I could do another pass and tighten up the CSS. Most importantly I'm using [Eleventy]() to build it and doing [fun (to me) things]() with spreadsheets that I turn into JSON, or just writing a list. I plan on constantly tweaking this site (type, layout, colors) and never really considering it _done_ until I start a new site. 

## A Few Words in Honor of the Old Site

I built the old site **eight years ago**! Back when I was bright-eyed and coding around the clock and doing things like [building my own static site generator](https://github.com/jlord/balrog) as a fun exercise. It was britle but it held up.
