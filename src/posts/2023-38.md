- I'm back in London. Seeing more than 6 people in a place at a time â€” incredible! But of course I haven't seen _too_ many people at once, because I have chosen to live in the _just busy enough_ part of London. 
- I was depressed for a lot of the week. Steroid-dizzy at times. Back to the same old, same old. 
- The British summer is weak enough that I didn't miss my tomato harvest! I now have too many tomatoes.
- I [read](/reading) what will probably be the last Ann Pratchett book I give a chance. Many rave over her work. I'm pretty meh on Claire Keegan, too. I don't know what this says about me. 
- I am, however, steadfastly a Joan Didion, Rachel Cusk and Natalia Ginzburg girlie. I don't know what this says about me.
- Still working my way through Seinfeld. I know the storylines are intentionally improbable and outrageous but being single in your late 30s and having nearby friends in the same boat? Come on! 
- Great article: [The Return of the Marriage Plot](https://www.thecut.com/article/why-is-everyone-so-eager-for-men-and-women-to-get-married.html).
- Eleventy, what this site is built on, decided to alter all post dates by 24hrs. I can't be bothered to figure it out so we're living in an alternate timeline.
