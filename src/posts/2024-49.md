- **2 years and counting of Long Covid.**
-  The first year was hospitalisations and lots of steroids. The second year has been immune suppressants and doctors who have given up. 
-  There is still no real idea how to fix me or an estimate of when I might be fixed other than “it could be years.”
-  I’ve not worked for at least a year of the last two (I suppose, I don’t feel like counting at the moment).
-  But I am extremely lucky—I always want to emphasise that. Covid will impact all of us and can do so much worse than it even has me.
-  I’m not sure how to write these posts, what impression I might give depending on what I choose to highlight. 
-  I have some good days and I’m less isolated than I was for 1.5 years. But I still have far more bad days mentally and physically. Existing in a world that ignores Covid is hard to do; day after day, month after month, year after year. 
-  It’s hard to find joy, purpose, community.
