- Very delayed posting this one but there isn't much to say.
- Loneliness is painful. Gutting. 
- Like a zombie I get up each day and try to make up a reason to exist. 
- The centre will not hold.
- Looked for kingfishers in two places, didn't see them. 
- Bookbinding tiny books to occupy myself. 
- Still itching, but it's better than it was.
