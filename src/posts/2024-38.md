- Hello, again. 
- I stopped posting last year because the posts were really quite depressing (as I have been) and because I suspected that the medical-leave insurance used by work to help cover unpaid medical leave periods would think that if I could post a blog  then I could work and therefore not cover the time I had to take off of work.
