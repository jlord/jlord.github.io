- I've read that recovery is not linear. This week was a down week. Tired. A little poorly. No people (besides hairdresser and doctor). 
- I was so, so tired. Perhaps I did too much last weekend (many miles walked), perhaps it's the hay fever and my severe allergies, it's definitely recovery and it's probably also the questionable state of my immune system now. I went to bed early and slept a lot.
- I started a new team at work which meant a lot of Zooms to meet everyone (they are very lovely!) and get oriented (but that drained me, too). 
- I crashed emotionally by the end of the week, déjà vu of being ill, not knowing why, being alone (my ebbs and flows only relevant to me), tired of tracking symptoms.
- My post-everything blood has been drawn, vials off to wherever they go. If everything looks good I'll be officially discharged. The doctor called my case _very unusual_.
- It's another 3-day weekend in the UK—never mind why—and oh, my goodness, a long weekend is so good (even if I did get a bit bored). Every week should be a 4-day week!
- I gave away my extra tomato plants (that I grew from seeds I took, fermented and dried from a lovely farmer's market tomato) and they were all quickly taken, that brought me joy! 
- I got my haircut after over a year and that's brought me joy, too!
- It's pick-gross-snails-off-of-things-dear-to-me season again here in the UK. Yuck.
