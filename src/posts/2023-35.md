- I flew to Georgia on a booked-last-minute flight now that I'm done with appointments for 6 weeks, to see my family, my brand new niece and to not be so alone when weaning-off steroids and in general. This trip has been long delayed because of—_waves hands_—everything.
- I upgraded my flight because I'm freaking out about covid and wanted to share air with fewer people, even though I'd be masking no matter what, of course. 4 of the 6 friends I've seen in the last couple of months have gotten covid again recently. I'm not loving that data point!
- I forgot to calculate the impact of timezones and a 29-hour travel day with my steroid plan. Had a wonky first two days but got on new sleep and steroid schedule without too much difficulty. 
- At 39.99 years of age my mother drove me to the DMV to get my drivers license. I was 12 days shy of it being so expired that Georgia would make me start over with written and driving tests and I don't even know who drives on what side of the road anymore so it's great I avoided being asked!
- I didn't get covid from the flight or the DMV!
- It is **so, so, so, so, so very good to be around people**. My brother and sister in law are two of my favorite people, too. Also, it's so good to be eating [boiled peanuts](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17845752009059652/) again.
