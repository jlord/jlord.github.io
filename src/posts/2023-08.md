Sometime, more than two years ago. I started a new site. It was on Glitch, I wanted a simple site and that was straight forward enough but then I spent a very long time fussing with type, colours and formatting. Anyway, I actually still quite like my previous site but I'm excited to move to this new site, officially. I also **plan to continue fussing around and changing it as often as pleases me**. 

## Previous Site
- Custom SSG

## New Site
- Simple

Here is my promise:  

> _I will continuously change this!_
