- I bought a flat and I'm on steroids again so I'm feeling great!
- I am still really itchy, rashy and the bloodwork is showing my body is still responding to an allergic reaction so back on steroids to help kick it. I have a call with an immunologist this week. 
- After **nine long months** I finally got the flat I made an offer on. Dear reader, I wish it had ended thereâ€”but the seller ripped out the light fixtures leaving nothing but bare wires (violating the contract) so I'm still having to chase them. They left junk as well but lights, lights would be nice. 
- I spent some time this weekend cleaning and feeling otherwise pleased that I do really like the place and it's the perfect size for projects to be fun and manageable. 
- However, there was a mouse murder in the new garden over the weekend. I saw the same ginger cat twice yesterday as I cleaned. I know what you've done, buddy.
- [Mu-An](https://muan.co), who is the best, was in town again this week, what a treat!
