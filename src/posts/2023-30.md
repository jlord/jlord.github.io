- I forgot to build the site last week so the short and sad weekly did not go out until today, oops. 
- I'm on medical leave now. 
- I chased doctors for instructions on how to medicate / care for myself in the wake of doctor strikes which left me appointment-less. It's exhausting. I am exhausted. 
- It's hard to rally and flip a switch to: _OK, let's make some money for `${BIGTECHCOMPANYIWORKFOR}`_, when despite all your best efforts you can't even keep yourself well.
- Steroids suck. I'm so tired of them. I'm on them for another month though, my longest stint. 
- I used to think they made me invincible, hyper and able to deal with life better because they were pumping me with hormones but turns out they can giveth _and_ taketh, in terms of moods. This round has been more of the latter. 
- Nice things: I got internet at the new flat, I went to a ballet and had Taiwanese food, the tomatoes are not giving up though this cold summer's made it a slog.
