- I saw Tar. I thought it wasn't as clever as it thought it was but soon I'll have spent an equal amount of time reading about it and thinking about it. 
- It was week 7 of covid. My left side neurological (allegedly) issues dissipated a great deal and my left leg neurological (MRI proven) issues flared up to fill the void.
- That meant for most of the week I _could_ walk but it required _thinking_ about _what walking looks like_ in order to pull it off. Standing up, sitting down and other sudden action were all reminders I wasn't confident on my feet.
- Travel obligations ended 10 Jan and I've had between 8-9 hours sleep daily since then and have been laying low and it's really helping.
- I'm getting stir crazy, though. It's hard for someone like me to sit still and now that—thanks to the UK not letting folks under 50 have a booster jab—I'm finally (ugh) better inoculated against covid I feel I can do a better job this year of getting out and seeing humans and I'd like that to be able to start already, thank you.
