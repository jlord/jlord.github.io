- A week off! I'd _originally_ taken this week off in March, to celebrate finishing my 3 months of Covid recovery only to have to cancel it from hospital because it would turn out I [wasn't quite done recovering](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrYCsJitauZ/). I worried about jinxing myself but booked the same trip and week off further out.
- So, 6 months after Covid turned all my days off into sick days and put me through the ringer, I finally had some proper time off! I took the train to [Totnes in Devon](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs1HqVQtDow/), the southwest of England.
- I walked, I [read](/reading), I thought, I photo'd. I had some unavoidably awkward solo dining.  
- Back in London and with another day off I went to 3 (small) museums conveniently on my list and co-located.
- I did another bookbinding workshop! Surprisingly exhausting: many steps, lots of focus and lots of standing. But the result pleases me so!
- I don't want to go back to work.
