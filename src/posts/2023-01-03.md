- I suggested to a friend, "tell your brother how that makes you feel," to which he replied "I can't, I am British!!"
- I brought back butter popcorn from the US in December because I thought I'd missed it. Now that I've had it again it's clear my heart now belongs to: mixed, salty and sweet. Butter can see itself out.
- I'm still recoverying from covid. It's week 5. It could be worse but it still sucks. I'm staying in a lot, sleeping lots, staying quite local. 
- Not brazenly but less skiddishly I'm now venturing to a local co-working space, (just on the otherside of a lovely park where after Christmas the goats get the trees) where who knows what germs are swapped, and it's been really, really nice to see other humans and to leave the house.
- I've started a new project at work and it's been great to be far less stressed and to feel energized and optimistic rather than deflated, dragging and drowning!
