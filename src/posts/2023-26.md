- Posting on a Tuesday again.
- Spent another day in A&E. After spending nearly a week trying to get ahold of my local GP. 
- After I got off the 5 days of steroids my allergic reaction (which never completely went away) came right back and flared up, moving to my hands and causing such immense pain/burning/swelling. Especially in the mornings. Lots of tears. 
- So I was back on steroids again Friday. 
- But I did have a lovely, full weekend and saw 3 friends. I did a lot of cleaning at the new flat. Saw a film. Had a pub roast. Pints. 
- But I am so tired. Moving, being ill; there's still too much going on. 
- Everyone wants to send well wishes and ask if they can help but no one can. What I need are people to go with me to appointments, to help me make appointments/clean my dishes/make me food when I'm ill or have spent half the day back at the hospital again. They have their own lives and partners so I get it and I don't expect it but I also am a bit over telling people _thanks for the sentiment_ -- frankly I don't have the time, I need to be getting back to doing it all.
