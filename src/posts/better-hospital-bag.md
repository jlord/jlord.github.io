I spent 8 days in hospital this month (so far, let's keep our fingers crossed). I was pretty sure when I headed into A&E that I wouldn't be sent home so I thought, _I'd better think ahead and pack well_: I packed my iPad, phone and chargers. This was not quite good enough. I will give myself credit for wearing elastic cotton pants and a sports bra which was perfect.

Here's what would have been much better to pack:

- **Tweezers, nail clippers and nail file** — Chin hairs! Nails that are far too long after one week!
- **Flushable wipes** — Because you're hooked up to a drip and not showering.
- **Toothbrush and toothpaste** — Because eventually your mouth sores will heal and you'll want to not be cutting your tongue on your tooth grime.
- **Eye mask** — Good lord there are a lot of lights at the hospital, even when you're in your own room the lights are on and they're checking you're alive. Also you might want to go to bed at 7. This are probably the most important, actually.
- **Hairbrush** — Wow, your hair up in a bun on your head for a week is a mess.
- **Dry shampoo powder** — Because I happen to have that format, seems better than an aerosol in a hospital and it helps!
- **Underwear** — Though it's really camp-life there and you don't get up to much, it's nice to have a couple of pair.
- **Notebook and pen** — For all the things that come to mind _after_ the doctors rounds.
- **Books, magazines, Switch** — I actually enjoyed not having anything to do and preferred that for my usually restless brain but it was nice to have some options sometimes.


Thank you to the friends who brought me these things throughout the week <3.
