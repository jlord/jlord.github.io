- I turned 40. 
- Single women aren't supposed to do that. My feelings on this particular milestone in the year-of-ill are far too complex for the weekly update. 
- I set the menu: pulled pork sandwiches with slaw and Carolina-style BBQ sauce, buffalo cauliflower, German chocolate cake and pi√±a coladas with my family at my parents' house.
- I tried to find unproblematic postcards from our small middle Georgia town with some literary clout, but I did not. 
- I started watching Seinfeld for the first time. Slightly distracted by Elaine casually making an Egg Cream at Jerry's in an episode and by how many tall glasses of milk they drink when visiting.
- Pretty tearful. Untethered.
- I flew back to London. One more week of medical leave to go. Three more weeks of steroids.
