- So many things to think about.
- My niece was born! I'm an aunt now. I love her.
- After a lull, a week with some activities and some humans: dinner with a friend in town, book talk with a local friend, current-events dinner hosted by group I'm attending in hopes to make friends, transit museum depot with friend in town.
- London had transit before my neighborhood existed and my neighborhood is still 120 years old.
- What am I great at? What do I like to do?
- Binged the shows Jury Duty and Couples Therapy. 
- Steam a sweet potato for 30 minutes + lentils, yogurt, herbs and lemon juice.
