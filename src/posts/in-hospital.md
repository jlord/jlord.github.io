In March I was in hospital for 8 days because my immune system attacked _me_ (us!?) and after two wrong diagnoses over the course of a week I was admitted. The doctors—at this stage of the illness—felt I had the very rare Stevens Johnsons Syndrome and weeks later, when the biopsies came back, they'd confirm it. But this is about the hospital stay. 

I was hooked to a saline drip feed as soon as I was seen in A&E. I could feel the water coursing through me and I realize how dehydrated I'd been (I was ill enough that sitting up to drink water at home was difficult). I rolled my pouch's pole alongside me, following behind a nurses assistant, to my ward. I don't know if they use this word in the US, but here _areas_ are _wards_. I learned I was in Ward 8 North, which was general admittance. My roommates could be here, like me, for any reason.
