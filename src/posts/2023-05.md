- Gosh, I love red lentils! I made [this soup](https://annajones.co.uk/recipe/lemony-lentil-crispy-kale-soup) this week (I love [Anna Jones](https://www.annajones.co.uk/)) but more than any other soup I've made [this one](https://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/red-lentil-soup-recipe.html) (I love [Heidi Swanson](https://101cookbooks.com/)).
- Taxes, buying a flat, and covid-recovery (week 8) gave me plenty of stress this week. I stressed about work, too, unclear if necessary.
- I saw [All the Beauty and the Bloodshed](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_the_beauty_and_the_bloodshed), it was absolutely incredible.
- I spent Sunday cleaning up all my gardening supplies and sewing some seeds: heirloom tomatoes (that I harvested from posh farmer's market tomatoes in 2020), chives, micro greens, trailing flower and two other flowers.
