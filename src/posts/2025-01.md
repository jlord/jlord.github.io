- I still struggle to know how I want to represent my weeks. I’m afraid of posting about things such that anyone gets the picture that I’m _doing well_ or doesn’t know that in 2025 Covid is still a large and limiting part of my life.
- I am not doing well. But I try. It’s really hard and I struggle a lot. 
- Having Long Covid and living in a world which _thinks_ it has moved on from Covid sucks. I wish I could be optimistic that my Long Covid will improve any this year but I can’t. 
- The best I can realistically hope for is that my mental health improves. I’ve started with a new therapist who specialises in neurodiversity. It’s early days but so far looking at _the state of me_ through a neurodivergent lens and considering the trauma and isolation of Long Covid has given me hope.
- Anyway, sorry about banging on about Covid _again_.
- Despite it all, there is light in my life (it is a person) and I started the new year as a (US) Southerner ought to with back eyed peas, cornbread, ham and greens. 
- An embroidery sampler, my umpteenth calendar layout in Figma and re-watching Severance have made me lose track of time and not think about much else—which is ideal. 
- I took down my Christmas decorations. The neighbours really liked my tiny trees and fairy lights in the window!
