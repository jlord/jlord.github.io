- **Long Covid Week — 120**
- Above is how I've decided I'll note that my Long Covid is ongoing and a big (bad) part of my life, despite anything nice I might mention. **The pandemic is ongoing**.
- Thankful for UK Traitors and Severance for giving me things to schedule and fixate on.
- Not entirely satisfied with the end of UK Traitors this season but I still massively enjoy the show. My one reality tv fix unless The Repair Shop and Antiques Roadshow count.
- I'm getting a studio space! Sharing a very small flat (even when in love) plus upstairs neighbours that make too much noise has pushed neurodivergent-me to the limit of the limit that ill-me was already balancing on.
- I can’t believe I didn’t think about it earlier, options for safe spaces to breathe for hours—besides home—are almost nil.
- I’m looking forward to making a mess and making things just to make things and hopefully finding some peace and having nice walks to and fro.
- The UK doesn’t have as good of online pen shops as the US has in [jetpens.com](https://jetpens.com), this is frustrating. (And JetPens has terrible UK shipping, which I’m sure is the UK’s fault not theirs.) 
- All of the sudden, after years of no issues, a new Pilot Hi-Tec-C .25 (the best) pen started to feather with highlighters. It’s driving me mad and so now I’m trying to test all the extra fine needle nose gel pens I can.
