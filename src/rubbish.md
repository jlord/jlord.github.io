I spend a lot (too much) time thinking and searching before I buy and I believe it will help me recover from let downs telling you what still, in the end, turned out to be rubbish. 

- [Hay Sowden Toaster](https://www.sowdenathome.com/shop/toaster-blue) - I love Hay. But. It toasts so unevenly, it's too short for a regular loaf slice of bread.
- [Hay Sowden Kettle](https://www.sowdenathome.com/shop/kettle-brown) â€” Another Hay disappointment. The thermometer has stopped working, the lid doesn't shut after one boil, it takes FOREVER to boil and it's LOUD.
