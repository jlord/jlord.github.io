I'm an urban designer turned open web developer and product manager, which isn't as odd as it sounds. I've coded since middle school but intentionally avoided it as a career until I saw it as a means of solving problems I cared about: open source. My architect-brain puts users first, I'm always thinking about how people understand the environment and systems they're in. All together I'm well suited as a product manager on a technical product and I love working to make open source more sustainable and to build avenues for creating and building the web for all.

<!-- I lead [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors). I hail from the geographic center of the state of Georgia and reside in London, England.  -->

<!-- I'm a backend engineer at [Splice](https://splice.com). Before that I worked on a bunch of things at [GitHub](https://github.com), last was starting the [Electron](https://electronjs.org) team. The year that changed everything was being a [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org) fellow in 2012.

I did the fellowship after working at the City of Boston's Urban Design Technology group and an architecture firm. Before that I was in college, Georgia Tech, graduating with an architecture degree. Before all that I was an awkward teen in Middle Georgia and a baby!

I champion open knowledge, documentation, and kindness. Also: [open source is a privilege](/blog/osos-talk.html). Selected side projects are on my [work](/work.html) page. -->
