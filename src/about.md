I'm an architect turned open web developer and product manager, which isn't as odd as it sounds. I've coded since middle school but intentionally avoided it as a career until I saw it as a means of solving problems I cared about: open source. My architect-brain puts users first, I'm always thinking about how people understand the environment and systems they're in. All together I'm well suited as a product manager on a technical product and I love working to make open source more sustainable and to build an accessible web for all.

<p>But I am more than my work! In the midst of the pandemic in 2020 I moved myself to London after discovering I'm <em>technically</em> British and the UK gave me a passport. Here I endulge in long city walks, canal walks and village walks. Train trips and buildings as old as time. I've got a camera with me most of the time, drink lots of tea and am perfecting my Sunday Roast. </p>

<!-- I'm a backend engineer at [Splice](https://splice.com). Before that I worked on a bunch of things at [GitHub](https://github.com), last was starting the [Electron](https://electronjs.org) team. The year that changed everything was being a [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org) fellow in 2012.

I did the fellowship after working at the City of Boston's Urban Design Technology group and an architecture firm. Before that I was in college, Georgia Tech, graduating with an architecture degree. Before all that I was an awkward teen in Middle Georgia and a baby!

I champion open knowledge, documentation, and kindness. Also: [open source is a privilege](/blog/osos-talk.html). Selected side projects are on my [work](/work.html) page. -->
