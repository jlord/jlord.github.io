I'm an architect turned open web developer and product manager, which isn't as odd as it sounds. I've coded since middle school but intentionally avoided it as a career until I saw it as a means of solving problems I cared about: open source. My architect-brain puts users first, I'm always thinking about how people understand the environment and systems they're in. All together I'm well suited as a product manager on a technical product and I love working to make open source more sustainable and to build an accessible web for all.

## Highlights
- After college, as an **architect** I worked in a small Atlanta firm designing single and multi-family homes. Earned LEED BD&C accreditation (since lapsed, of course).
- As an **urban designer for the City of Boston** in the Urban Design Technology Group, I worked on neighbourhood planning, modelling studies and building design rebuttals. Earned LEED ND accreditation (since lapsed, of course).
- In 2012 I received a **Code for America fellowship** and built an open source budget transparency tool for city governments. 
- With a grant from Mozilla Open News I turned that budget tool into a general purpose, open source, spreadsheet-as-database tool. 
- After **joining GitHub as a software developer** in 2013 I worked across dotcom, created a Git & GitHub learning event, application and course material (still in use) and **started the Electron team**, the library that now powers apps such as Slack, Teams, Skype, Figma, Notion and much, much more. 
- At Splice and Glitch I developed my engineering and engineering leadership skills, eventually becoming a **Director of Engineering**.
- In 2021, I **re-joined GitHub** to lead the Sponsors team, the functionality within GitHub that aims to help **make open source sustainability a reality** and has seen over $30M pass through the program.
- I've given **talks across the globe**  to audiences small and large about open source, specific technologies and best practices.

## But also

<p>I am more than my work! In the midst of the pandemic in 2020 I moved myself to London after discovering I'm <em>technically</em> British and the UK gave me a passport. Here I indulge in long city walks, long canal walks and long village walks. Sitting on a train is my happy place. I've got a camera with me most of the time, drink lots of tea and am perfecting my roasties. </p>
