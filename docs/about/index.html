I'm an architect turned developer and product manager, which isn't as odd as it sounds. I've coded since middle school but intentionally avoided it as a career until I saw it as a means of solving problems I cared about: open source. My architect-brain puts users first, I'm always thinking about how people understand the environment they're in. All together, I'm well suited as a product manager on a technical product. I love open source and working to build an approachable web for all.<br> <br>In December 2022 I contracted Covid for the first time which led to Long Covid immune dysfunction and continues today. I left work in August 2024 to destress and focus on my recovery. A year later, I'm excited to now return to the energy of work and building good things with great people.

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>After college, as an <strong>architect</strong> I worked in a small Atlanta firm designing single and multi-family homes. Earned LEED BD&amp;C accreditation (since lapsed, of course).</li>
<li>As an <strong>urban designer for the City of Boston</strong> in the Urban Design Technology Group, I worked on neighbourhood planning, modelling studies and building design rebuttals. Earned LEED ND accreditation (since lapsed, of course).</li>
<li>In 2012 I received a <strong>Code for America fellowship</strong> and built an open source budget transparency tool for city governments.</li>
<li>With a <strong>grant from Knight-Mozilla Open News</strong> I turned that budget tool into a general purpose, open source, spreadsheet-as-database tool.</li>
<li>After <strong>joining GitHub as a software developer</strong> in 2013 I worked across dotcom, created a Git &amp; GitHub learning event, application and course material (still in use) and <strong>started the Electron team</strong>, the library that now powers apps such as Slack, Teams, Skype, Figma, Notion and much more.</li>
<li>At Splice and Glitch I developed my engineering and engineering leadership skills, eventually becoming a <strong>Director of Engineering</strong>. I loved working on a code editor at Glitch.</li>
<li>A bucket list opportunity: I worked with the non-profit arm of my favourite urban designer's firm, <strong>Gehl Institute</strong>, to open source their standard for measuring public life in a city.</li>
<li>In 2021, I <strong>re-joined GitHub</strong> to lead the Sponsors team, the functionality within GitHub that aims to help <strong>make open source sustainability a reality</strong> and has seen over $30M pass through the program.</li>
<li>I've given <strong>talks across the globe</strong>  to audiences small and large about open source, specific technologies and best practices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>But also</h2>
<p>I am more than my work! In the midst of the pandemic in 2020 I moved myself to London after discovering I'm <em>technically</em> British and the UK gave me a passport. Here I indulge in long city walks, long canal walks and long village walks. Sitting on a train is my happy place. I've got a camera with me most of the time, lots of pens and stationery and I am perfecting my roasties.</p>
