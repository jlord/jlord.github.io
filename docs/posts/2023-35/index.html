<li>I flew to Georgia on a booked-last-minute flight now that I'm done with appointments for 6 weeks, to see my family, my brand new niece and to not be so alone when weaning-off steroids and in general. This trip has been long delayed because of—<em>waves hands</em>—everything.</li>
<li>I upgraded my flight because I'm freaking out about covid and wanted to share air with fewer people, even though I'd be masking no matter what, of course. 4 of the 6 friends I've seen in the last couple of months have gotten covid again recently. I'm not loving that data point!</li>
<li>I forgot to calculate the impact of timezones and a 29-hour travel day with my steroid plan. Had a wonky first two days but got on new sleep and steroid schedule without too much difficulty.</li>
<li>At 39.99 years of age my mother drove me to the DMV to get my drivers license. I was 12 days shy of it being so expired that Georgia would make me start over with written and driving tests and I don't even know who drives on what side of the road anymore so it's great I avoided being asked!</li>
<li>I didn't get covid from the flight or the DMV!</li>
<li>It is <strong>so, so, so, so, so very good to be around people</strong>. My brother and sister in law are two of my favorite people, too. Also, it's so good to be eating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17845752009059652/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boiled peanuts</a> again.</li>
