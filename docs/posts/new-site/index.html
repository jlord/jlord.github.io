            <p>As <a href="https://muan.co/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@muan</a> says, I'm &quot;making modest websites.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't even dislike my old site (now in this <a href="https://github.com/jlord/old-site" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo</a>, at <a href="https://jlord.github.io/old-site" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this address</a>). I love what I've called for years now <em>website blue</em>, the shock of colbalt (and here it persists). I like the type enough that it's what's on this new site, too. But I felt like something new and I felt like something really simple. So I've spent about two years just fussing with colors. Anyway, <strong>long live HTML and CSS</strong>.</p>

<h2>A Few Words on the New Site</h2>
<p>How simple can I make this? It's left aligned! No buttons?! I could do another pass and tighten up the CSS. Most importantly I'm using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eleventy</a>, rather than my own creation (see below), to build it and doing <a href="">fun (to me) things</a> with spreadsheets that I turn into JSON, or just writing a list. I plan on constantly tweaking this site (type, layout, colors) and never really considering it <em>done</em> until I start a new site. I will keep trying to keep it simple.</p>

<figcaption>Great work!</figcaption>
<p>I built the old site <strong>ten years ago</strong>! Back when I was bright-eyed and coding around the clock and doing things like <a href="https://github.com/jlord/balrog" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building my own static site generator</a> as a fun exercise. It was brittle but it's held up. I learned lots from <a href="https://bjb.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@brianloveswords</a> at that time and he has since taught me many things like SQL, skillet chicken and how to handle finances.</p>
<p>Goodbye old site, you were made with love and I will not forget you!</p>
