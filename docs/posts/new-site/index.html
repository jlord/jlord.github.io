<p>I don't even dislike my old site (now in this <a href="https://github.com/jlord/old-site" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo</a>, at <a href="https://jlord.github.io/old-site" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this address</a>). I love what I've called for years now <em>website blue</em>, the shock of colbalt (and here it persists). I like the type enough that it's what's on this new site, too. But I felt like something new and I felt like something really simple. So I've spent about two years fussing with colors. Anyway, <strong>long live HTML and CSS</strong>.</p>
<h2>A Few Words on the New Site</h2>
<p>How simple can I make this? It's left aligned! No buttons?! I could do another pass and tighten up the CSS. Most importantly I'm using <a href="">Eleventy</a> to build it and doing <a href="">fun (to me) things</a> with spreadsheets that I turn into JSON, or just writing a list. I plan on constantly tweaking this site (type, layout, colors) and never really considering it <em>done</em> until I start a new site.</p>
<h2>A Few Words in Honor of the Old Site</h2>
<p>I built the old site <strong>eight years ago</strong>! Back when I was bright-eyed and coding around the clock and doing things like <a href="https://github.com/jlord/balrog" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building my own static site generator</a> as a fun exercise. It was britle but it held up.</p>
