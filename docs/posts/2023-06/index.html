            <ul>
<li>I went to my first conference for work in maybe 3 years, sometime before the pandemic anyway. It was so good to see co-workers, peers and to try to make friends with the crew at the BBC R&amp;D booth across from ours. <a href="https://twitter.com/jllord/status/1623250828571078656" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lovely mornings</a> in town, too.</li>
<li>Speaking of work. My work—in line with (I have a lot more feelings on this) the other tech companies— announced layoffs, it was a stressful week.</li>
<li>I decided to let myself off my post-covid rest plan a few days early for the benefit that being on a train and going somewhere new brings my head and my heart. I went to Whitstable on the Kent coast. It was lovely.</li>
<li>Traveling solo is fine. Sometimes it's what I need but most of the time it's just fine. I've done it a lot; it's fine.</li>
<li>I went to Cookham (again, prioritizing mental health over post-covid physical health at the moment) for a country pub roast with a friend. Met their friend and 3 dogs (Bertie, Rufus, Casper). Thank god for pubs.</li>
<li>I'm reading a <a href="/reading">great book</a>, the third I've read by Natalia Ginzburg. I love her writing:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Then Anna asked where justice could be found, if the kingdom of heaven, where it could have been found, did not exist. Giuma said it certainly was a pity not to be able to find it anywhere.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It's month 5 of what should have been a straightforward two-way chain-free purchase of a flat for me. It's really annoying. So is still paying loads of money to a crappy landlord for a rented flat that drives me nuts in a dozen small ways each day.</li>
<li>I am so tired of all the Life Admin that's dragging on. This is a bleak post!</li>
</ul>
