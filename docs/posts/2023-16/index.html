<li>I felt so much more like myself this week. The effects of weaning off the steroids having tettered off. I won't indulge in too much jubilation, <a href="/posts/2023-09">7 weeks ago when I last celebrated better health</a>, I shortly thereafter ended up far worse off.</li>
<li>The isolation of illness, singleness, newness to a country and remote work has been compounded by chaos at work leaving me on a team of 1 (for now). So little human interaction across the board. I found it really difficult to use my brain and to work this week.</li>
<li>But, I did some normal life things! I am trying to book in as many as I can now, in a reasonable way, so that I have something to sustain me should things get worse again.</li>
<li>I went to a climate protest and walked around a nice neighborhood and went a couple-friend's place for dinner. I had coffee with a new friend!</li>
<li>I'm <a href="/reading">reading</a> <em>Arrangements in Blue</em> by Amy Key and never have I felt so <em>seen</em>. Adult singleness articulated so well. Also, Joni Mitchell.</li>
<li>I've stayed away from Instagram for months now, the happy posts of people not ill and people not alone had not been great for my health. But I came back to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CrYCsJitauZ/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post a bit about my health</a>, now that I'm on the other side of recent ailments and learned about other friends struggling with covid and other long term illnesses. I'm glad I  shared (but sad we have to deal with these things).</li>
