<li>Welp, was bAcK iN tHe hOsPiTaL this week!</li>
<li>My body flipped out over an antibiotic I'd had 3 times in the last 2 years and as recently as November. Face and throat swollen, rash and hives from scalp to toe.</li>
<li>But I got to ride in an ambulance! I had the best EMTs, I would have hung out with them all night, if it weren't, you know, for my immune system being so fussy.</li>
<li>They sure do run a hospital all night long. They took me for a chest x-ray at 3am. I was miserably itchy and nauseous.</li>
<li>Covid has wrecked my immune system. For how long? What else will happen?</li>
<li>The weekend, quite opposite, was marvelous. Sunny. Warm with a breeze. Bird-watched in my garden. Frozen margaritas in my garden with one friend and reading in the park with another.</li>
<li>I finished <a href="/reading">reading</a> <em>The Trouble with Happiness</em> by Tove Ditlevsen. It's grim. So Danish.</li>
<li>I am still quite itchy all over.</li>
<li>There's a lot on my plate and a lot in the air.</li>
</ul>
