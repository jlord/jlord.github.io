<li>I still struggle to know how I want to represent my weeks. I’m afraid of posting about things such that anyone gets the picture that I’m <em>doing well</em> or doesn’t know that in 2025 Covid is still a large and limiting part of my life.</li>
<li>I am not doing well. But I try. It’s really hard and I struggle a lot.</li>
<li>Having Long Covid and living in a world which <em>thinks</em> it has moved on from Covid sucks. I wish I could be optimistic that my Long Covid will improve any this year but I can’t.</li>
<li>The best I can realistically hope for is that my mental health improves. I’ve started with a new therapist who specialises in neurodiversity. It’s early days but so far looking at <em>the state of me</em> through a neurodivergent lens and considering the trauma and isolation of Long Covid has given me hope.</li>
<li>Anyway, sorry about banging on about Covid <em>again</em>.</li>
<li>Despite it all, there is light in my life (it is a person) and I started the new year as a (US) Southerner ought to with back eyed peas, cornbread, ham and greens.</li>
<li>An embroidery sampler, my umpteenth calendar layout in Figma and re-watching Severance have made me lose track of time and not think about much else—which is ideal.</li>
<li>I took down my Christmas decorations. The neighbours really liked my tiny trees and fairy lights in the window!</li>
