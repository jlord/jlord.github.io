<p><em>I originally posted this elsewhere 2018-11-20 but ported it here to have a sample post in order to design this blog.</em></p>
<p>I love learning about the history of English, especially Old English. A while ago I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stories-English-David-Crystal/dp/1585677191" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stories of English</em></a> and loved it so much that I have moved with it for a decade, across the Atlantic and twice across the US.</p>
<p>Last year I started learning Danish (with the help of <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/course/da/en/Learn-Danish-Online" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duolingo</a> and Danish friends) and it re-ignited my interest in Old English. So I've read more and am 100+ hours into The History of English podcast, which is incredible. The podcast is so throughly researched and presented!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Danish has come to make a lot more sense! Instead of thinking of it as learning a new word for everything there are now many words for which a pattern can be applied to transform it into a modern English word or the Danish word is the same or nearly so as a now lost Old English word.</p>
<ul>
<li>'sk' pairs in Old Norse became 'sh' in English so <em>skip</em> became <em>ship</em> (b's often became p's) and <em>vask</em> became <em>wash</em> (v's often became w's, think about <em>wine</em> and <em>vin</em>)</li>
<li>Old English's <em>fugol</em> for bird and <em>fugl</em> in Danish; Old English's <em>hus</em> for <em>house</em> is still <em>hus</em> in Danish.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love learning these patterns and the history behind all the changes in the language (though I do wish English had remained more Nordic/Germanic). And I love to share random etymology facts!</p>
