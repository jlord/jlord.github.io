            <p>I challenged myself to test out an idea for a informational site on a technical thing, Electron, that tried to be as concise and plainly worded as I could get it. So here's <a href="http://jlord.us/essential-electron">Essential Electron</a>, something I'll keep tweaking!</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1305617/17867404/3e699c20-685f-11e6-9303-c98862a0540a.png" alt="Essential Electron screenshot"></p>
<p>Technical documentation can be long, jargon-heavy and hard to know where to begin with. I think having detailed documentation is good in general, but I felt there was a place for something simpler and took you from top to bottom on the topic in one go.</p>
<p>I set out last week to try and see what this idea might look like, which resulted in <a href="http://jlord.us/essential-electron">Essential Electron</a>. It was an interesting challenge because I had to think about everything I wrote: is this <em>essential</em>, is this a new word or concept worth learning or is it jargon that can be expanded? And cut, cut, cut. I tried to use these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main section should be 2-3 sentences.</li>
<li>New concepts/words defined.</li>
<li>Jargon replaced with expanded phrasing.</li>
<li>Graphic added when applicable.</li>
<li>Links for more information provided in each section.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to take people through the flow of learning what Electron is, what development is like and how to get started, while remaining high-level. Someone should be able to go through each of the sections and only read the large text and still get a good sense of what Electron is. If a word or concept is new they can check the definitions. If a particular section is of interest they can use the resources to get more information.</p>
<p>I pulled and tweaked some graphics from a previous workshop I'd done to help illustrate this points. I'm pretty happy with the experiment though I have some more ideas and will keep refining this. Hope it turns out useful to some!</p>
