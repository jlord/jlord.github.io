<li>I've fallen behind again. Here come 3 posts!</li>
<li>It's very hard for me to sit still and <em>rest</em> at home. It's partly because that's how I am and it's partly the energy side-effect of the steroids. So I put myself on a train and got out of town for a couple of days.</li>
<li>It was great to have no dishes, laundry or new house chores I could possibly do and generally few options of what to do.</li>
<li>Back at home, my friend came over and co-worked with me one day so that I'd also not have to fight the urge to do a lot of stuff and could sit still.</li>
<li>I began a battle with my old landlord who had not, at this point, returned my deposit as required within 10 days.</li>
