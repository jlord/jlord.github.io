<li>So much time spent researching, dealing with insurance, doctors and trying to get my head just above water, to give myself some sense—real or not—that I should most certainly keep on on keeping on.</li>
<li>It feels strange to <em>text back</em>, which can appear so normal and that <em>I'm normal</em>, when things are actually a bummer. I often feel so <em>alone-squared</em> because I'm literally (most often) alone without other humans and (my local world) alone in how covid is real and I have to live as such and alone (my illness) in that so few <em>see me</em> when things are bad and so few <em>get it</em>.</li>
<li>I tried to write a web scraper. It's been years since I really wrote Node or JS. How did I make this site? Oof. I also hate coding alone.</li>
<li>I guess the thing about me is I like hanging out. I'm on the last season of Seinfeld now and am so jealous of having friends to hang out with and do nothing.</li>
<li>But it is what it is so I took myself to see a football match. It wasn't as weird as I thought being alone and it was amazing to be so close to the pitch—I was on row one (I figured less people breathing germs on me). But it was more weird than I thought to be alone in masking in a group of thousands packed in together (at least it's an open-air stadium).</li>
<li>What a fun blog this is!</li>
