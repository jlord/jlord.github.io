<li>Spoiler Alert! Greetings from the future (week 40) where I am Out of Office—unwell again. But here's what happened last week (39).</li>
<li>As I got closer to 0mg of steroids a rash started appearing and worsened each day. It was a dizzy, woozy and itchy week.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, I pushed and tried to do as good as I could on my first week back to work after 2 months away.</li>
<li>My team at work is full of wonderful humans and I'm thankful for that. I wish we all lived in the same city.</li>
<li>The flat upstairs' bathroom is leaking through my ceiling which is a super fun thing to deal with right after buying a place. Also a quick lesson on how being a 50/50 freeholder (a UK thing I won't go into detail about now) when the other half lets their property is kind of like being stuck with a landlord again. They want to do the repair work in my flat themselves, on their schedule. <em>Sigh</em>.</li>
<li>A new Covid <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study and paper</a> was released. Through blood they can now identify patients who have Long Covid with 96% accuracy. The paper also mentions the Epstein-Barr reactivation track of immune disfunction Long Covid. Woo!

</ul>
</li>
<li>I would like to talk more here about my other interests and career pursuits but Long Covid has frustrating a way of being the number one thing in your life.</li>
<li>I did manage a train jaunt to have lunch with a friend and her parents in Southampton. Not much to see there! But I can tick another UK city off my been-there list.</li>
