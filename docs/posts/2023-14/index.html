<p><em>England is never vulgar. I tis conventional, but not vulgar. Because it is sad it is never coarse.</em> — Natalia Ginzburg</p>

<p><em>Indeed nothing in the world is sadder than an English vonversation, in which everyone is careful to keep superficialities and never touch on anything essential.</em> — Natalia Ginzburg</p>

<li><strong>My biopsies came back!</strong> The doctor says I had Stevens Johnsons Syndrome (I'll let you Google it), as they originally thought. An whole-body immune response to, in my case, a virus, in my case, unknown, which occurs in 1-2 people per million. It feels really good to get some information!</li>
<li>They took my stitches out, the ones I had for the biopsy spots, the first stitches in my body!</li>
<li>I'm weaning off the steroids which is going pretty well though the second day on a new, lower dose gives me a bad night of sleep. In 3 more days I'll be done! I feel much more like myself as a person rather than a person <em>on drugs</em>.</li>
<li>I am <a href="/reading">reading</a> <em>The Little Virtues</em> by Natalia Ginzberg, my fourth (?) of hers. I love her writing. I love her pace, her characters. Earlier this year I read <em>All Our Yesterdays</em> which is now my favourite book. Anyway, she lived in London for a time it turns out and had some things to say about it.</li>
<li><strong>Thank goodness for a sunny four-day weekend</strong>. I perfected Milk Beach's sweet potato puree and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CcHzmYkgOp4/?hl=en" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baked egg in a jam jar</a>; oof it's so good.</li>
