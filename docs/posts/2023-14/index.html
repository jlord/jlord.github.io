<li><strong>My biopsies came back!</strong> The doctor says I had Stevens Johnsons Syndrome (I'll let you Google it), as they originally thought. An whole-body immune response to, in my case, a virus (in my case, unknown), which occurs in 1-2 people per million. It feels really good to get some information!</li>
<li>They took my stitches out, the ones I had for the biopsy spots, my first stitches in my body!</li>
<li>I'm weaning off the steroids which is going pretty well though the second day on a new dose gives me a bad night of sleep. In 3 more days I'll be done! I feel much more like myself as a person rather than a person <em>on drugs</em> and extremely hyper.</li>
