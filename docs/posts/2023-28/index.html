<li>Sorry, it's Tuesday again.</li>
<li>Last week was the last week before I started sleeping at the flat I bought. God, moving is stressful.</li>
<li>I've moved across the U.S. myself 3 times, within cities a handful more at least. This move down the street brought me to my knees. At the bottom of a dark pit. I'm not well, you see.</li>
<li>Purchasing this one particular place and moving into it has been a 10 month process which is not yet over as I do the remaining many tasks to get utilities set up and the old flat cleaned more than it was when I took it over because landlords are bastards. That's a long time to be stressed and have a lot of tasks.</li>
<li>Plus, there's the health stuff, on its 8th month now. My appt last week was cancelled due to doctor strikes and I'm trying to beg for someone, somewhere, in some medical capacity, to talk to me. Talk to me about the infection showing up in my last blood tests. Talk to me about how the steroids are making me woozy and how much longer I need them for. When can I get a covid jab?</li>
<li>I'm so tired. I need, please, to stop being in the middle of all of this still, I need some things to drop off the Life Admin list.</li>
</ul>
