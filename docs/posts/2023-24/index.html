            <ul>
<li>I wrote but forgot to publish last-last week's! And I'm writing last week's on a Tuesday! I don't care. Life is a lot. I don't feel great!</li>
<li>About 2 days after coming off the 5 days steroid course my allergic reaction has gotten worse. I was supposed to be referred to a consultant in &quot;Allergies and Immunology&quot; and the doctor I was referred to didn't want to meet face to face so just called me and after I told him everything he told me he considered himself <em>more of an allergist</em> and I should definitely see an immunologist (and dermatologist). So another week+ lost, back at square one.</li>
<li>I went to a book talk with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62698529-the-late-americans" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon Taylor</a>. I love writers!</li>
<li>On Wednesday the sellers of my flat had an electrician come round and install basic light fittings so now I properly have a flat! Then I had a lovely dinner in Camden with girlfriends.</li>
<li>My landlord listed my flat immediately upon my notice and <strong>raised the rent £550</strong>. He does not deserve it, he is shite. And I'm so sad that I've trigged this instance of the crap London rental situation.</li>
<li>Two of my 5 friends here have gotten their second bout of Covid in the last couple of weeks. Don't love that!</li>
<li>I've postponed my Covid vaccine indefinitely right now as my body is clearly still having an immune response and who knows what the vaccine will do on top of that.</li>
<li>I am going to try very hard to stay well enough to move on the 14th.</li>
<li>I went to <a href="https://www.theburntcity.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burnt City</a>, which is like Sleep No More in NYC (which I went to and loved years ago) and it was so good! <strong>It means so much to me that a spooky, quiet place filled with vignettes and ephemera exists</strong>. But I won't do a crowded inside thing again until after the 14th.</li>
</ul>
