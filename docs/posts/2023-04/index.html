            <ul>
<li>I saw Tar. I thought it wasn't as clever as it thought it was but soon I'll have spent an equal amount of time reading about it and thinking about it.</li>
<li>It was week 7 of covid. My left side neurological (allegedly) issues dissipated a great deal and my left leg neurological (MRI proven) issues flared up to fill the void.</li>
<li>That meant for most of the week I <em>could</em> walk but it required <em>thinking</em> about <em>what walking looks like</em> in order to pull it off. Standing up, sitting down and other sudden action were all reminders I wasn't confident on my feet.</li>
<li>Travel obligations ended 10 Jan and I've had between 8-9 hours sleep daily since then and have been laying low and it's really helping.</li>
<li>I'm getting stir crazy, though. It's hard for someone like me to sit still and now that—thanks to the UK not letting folks under 50 have a booster jab—I'm finally (ugh) better inoculated against covid I feel I can do a better job this year of getting out and seeing humans and I'd like that to be able to start already, thank you.</li>
