<li>Heyo, posting on a Monday, that's improvement.</li>
<li>Other improvements remain so-so.</li>
<li>The steroids really sent me for a ride last week—it was not great. My check-in at the hospital took 4 hours. I have one this week too.</li>
<li>A friend came over and spent and evening with me and that was crucial but there still was far too much of the maddening silence and aloneness.</li>
<li>The weekend, however, was redeeming; friends came together for another friend going through a breakup. I wish the circumstances were better but it was good to be together!</li>
<li>I think I might have gone a whole month without finishing a book? I've played a lot more Animal Crossing and mindlessly streamed court trials in the US on YouTube.</li>
<li>I move into <em>my</em> flat on Friday! Will be working extra hard to keep my brain ok with the checklists and deadlines.</li>
