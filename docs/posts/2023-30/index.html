            <ul>
<li>I forgot to build the site last week so the short and sad weekly did not go out until today, oops.</li>
<li>I'm on medical leave now.</li>
<li>I chased doctors for instructions on how to medicate / care for myself in the wake of doctor strikes which left me appointment-less. It's exhausting. I am exhausted.</li>
<li>It's hard to rally and flip a switch to: <em>OK, let's make some money for <code>${BIGTECHCOMPANYIWORKFOR}</code></em>, when despite all your best efforts you can't even keep yourself well.</li>
<li>Steroids suck. I'm so tired of them. I'm on them for another month though, my longest stint.</li>
<li>I used to think they made me invincible, hyper and able to deal with life better because they were pumping me with hormones but turns out they can giveth <em>and</em> taketh, in terms of moods. This round has been more of the latter.</li>
<li>Nice things: I got internet at the new flat, I went to a ballet and had Taiwanese food, the tomatoes are not giving up though this cold summer's made it a slog.</li>
