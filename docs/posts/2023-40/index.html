<li>I've entered my immunosuppressants era.</li>
<li>The awful, quality-of-life-destroying steroid era of the past few months is failed and over.</li>
<li>My check-in Friday went as they usually do: entirely new doctor who hasn't read my charts and I have to build up and convince him of my universe from the start. He was stumped, called in a consultant and I begged for no more steroids.</li>
<li>I <a href="/reading">read</a> <em>When We Cease to Understand the World</em> which was really different and fantastic. Science, eerie. Amazing connections between ideas and humans and war. I didn't love how women were treated and it centering just around men.</li>
<li>It's tough to be back at square one. Still suffering, still no idea if and when I'll be better. Still alone. Still in a world that thinks covid is no big deal.</li>
</ul>
