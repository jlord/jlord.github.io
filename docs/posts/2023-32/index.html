<li>As soon as I got back home from my short trip (therapy and doctors appts prevents me from truly getting away in a retreat-like situation for wellness like I'd like to) I fell apart, again.</li>
<li>Did you see a woman sobbing on the pavement near St James' Park?</li>
<li>I'm either manically high or low and most of the time I'm alone trying to battle it. If I can be around others it seems to be easier to cope.</li>
<li>A friend came to visit to keep me company then I went to see a friend for company.</li>
<li>I said goodbye to a friend moving back to the States.</li>
<li>I tried to escape again but this place that markets itself as a place to find wellness and relaxation was far from it, so much so that I left early.</li>
<li>Found out that my old landlord, in addition to not meeting the 10 day deadline for dealing with my deposit, also had not protected my deposit as is required by our Assured Shorthold Tenancy. These are huge breeches! I send more emails, hands shaking and heart pumping and he keeps ignoring me.</li>
