<li>I'm back in London. Seeing more than 6 people in a place at a time — incredible! But of course I haven't seen <em>too</em> many people at once, because I have chosen to live in the <em>just busy enough</em> part of London.</li>
<li>I was depressed for a lot of the week. Steroid-dizzy at times. Back to the same old, same old.</li>
<li>The British summer is weak enough that I didn't miss my tomato harvest! I now have too many tomatoes.</li>
<li>I <a href="/reading">read</a> what will probably be the last Ann Pratchett book I give a chance. Many rave over her work. I'm pretty meh on Claire Keegan, too. I don't know what this says about me.</li>
<li>I am, however, steadfastly a Joan Didion, Rachel Cusk and Natalia Ginzburg girlie. I don't know what this says about me.</li>
<li>Still working my way through Seinfeld. I know the storylines are intentionally improbable and outrageous but being single in your late 30s and having nearby friends in the same boat? Come on!</li>
<li>Great article: <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/why-is-everyone-so-eager-for-men-and-women-to-get-married.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Return of the Marriage Plot</a>.</li>
<li>Eleventy, what this site is built on, decided to alter all post dates by 24hrs. I can't be bothered to figure it out so we're living in an alternate timeline.</li>
