            <ul>
<li>I went to visit a friend who recently moved out of the city to a place called <strong>Orpington</strong> which means <em>connected to Orped's settlement</em>—I love <a href="http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Kent/Orpington">English place names</a>! We ate snacks and watched crime documentaries and it was the best! I rarely get this kind of easy hangout time as a single person who lives alone and doesn't have a ton of friends in the new country she moved herself to in a pandemic.</li>
<li>Entering in my 12th (and therefore last?) post-covid week, feeling better and better but I still need a lot of sleep. I also still have a couple of non-covid things to deal with so don't worry, plenty for me to still stress about.</li>
<li>I was sick all of December holidays so I'm really ready for (but haven't planned) some time off while being mostly well!</li>
<li>Oh! I went to see <a href="https://twitter.com/southbankcentre/status/1628881380330377217" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernie Sanders give a talk</a> about his new book, <em>It's OK to be Angry about Capitalism</em>, which was a double treat because <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaDabiri" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Dabiri</a> was the interviewer. Possibly I was in the lift with Jeremy Corbyn as well but we'll never know.</li>
<li>Long Tailed Tits visited my garden, incredible! I tried to get photos but just managed feeder-shots which is <em>ok</em>.</li>
<li>Farming update: tomato seedlings are thriving. Only one was a dud and didn't germinate properly. Poppies didn't germinate great but yarrow did! A couple more flowers starting to come up. In March I can start off some more!</li>
<li>The start of the week was pretty sad and lonely but it got better.</li>
</ul>
