            <p>I have a great fondness for brilliant and salty letters written in the past. Herein lies my collection.</p>
<p class="quote">"I lost my habit of punctual correspondence during the first few weeks of marriage because we quarrelled so continuously & really bitterly that I thought I'd save time & just write one letter to everyone when the murder or separation had been accomplished. Then Eric's aunt came to stay & was so dreadful (she stayed two months) that we stopped quarrelling & just repined. Then she went away & now all our troubles are over."</p><p> <span class="meta-text">George Orwell's (Eric) wife, Eileen Blair, to a friend after they were married, 1936 — Orwell's Roses, Rebecca Solnit</span></p>
