Hey Jessica,

Welcome to Pierre! AND congratulations on pushing your first change!

We do our best to summarize and categorize all the work you do (as seen above ^).

And the more you push, the more Pierre learns what type of engineer you are and what types of changes you actually care about.

To get started, click around a bunchâ€¦ ~~ maybe even highlight this **WORD** to leave a comment or suggest a change??

OR invite some friends, review some code, wire up some CI jobs, etcâ€¦

If you have questions or feedback at all â€“ head over to our Discord community â€“ weâ€™d love to hear from you: [https://discord.gg/QJtTu5hpzx](https://discord.gg/QJtTu5hpzx).

Oh, and when youâ€™re done, click that purple merge button over on the right ðŸ˜…

â€“Pierre
